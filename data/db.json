      "method": "In Greece you’ll most often find large tomatoes used, but cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes make for easy dicing. And for the feta, make sure to opt for a quality block of feta. I highly recommend you don’t buy pre-crumbled feta, due to the anti-caking additives I mentioned on my Zucchini Fries recipes.\n\nOnce you’ve got your ingredients ready, it’s as simple as slicing and dicing them to about the same size. And large chunks are preferred over a fine dice. Then, drizzle your salad with a Greek salad dressing and give it a gentle toss.\n\nIf you’re looking for another Greek recipe to serve alongside this salad, I highly recommend my Grilled Chicken Souvlaki or Greek Chicken Kabobs recipe.",
